Cure all cancers

# syn bio and ai and robots and chips for the win
a convergence of technologies is happening now that holds
immense potential for helping human health.  these are
artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, robotics
and miniturization.

# mining knowledge from a vast archive of science papers
there are approximately 100 million scientific papers
ever published and of those 30 million papers are in
biology.  we propose to use artificial intelligence
with retrieval augmented generation to solve various
biological problems.

# application areas in biology
There are many such problems in biology that we could
attack, such as life extension, development of vaccines,
treatment for rare diseases, development of new
antibiotics and cancer. 

# One new platform for cancer treatment
There are many different modalities of cancer treatment
One new platform that has been developed recently are
BiTES or bispecific t-cell engagers.  Tebentafusp is one
of the first BiTES to be approved by the FDA for
treatment of uveal melanoma, a particularily aggressive
eye cancer, others have been approved and more are in
development.

treatment of uveal melanoma, a particularily aggressive
eye cancer, others have been approved and more are in

A BiTE is a synthetic protein with two parts, one that
attaches to a killer T-cell from the human immune system.
The other is an antibody that attaches to a gp100
fragment presented by an MHC molecule on the cancer cell.
The BiTE brings both cells into contact, and the killer
T-cell destroys the cancer cell.

# BiTES
The important part of this is the gp100 protein, an
antigen that is found on uveal melanoma cells.  We
researched this and found that papers published long
before tebentafusp was developed had mentions of the
gp100 protein.  We propose to do this on an industrial
scale and try to cure all cancers, starting with the most
low hanging fruit.

# Our proposal
We propose to work with partners such as Ginkgo Bioworks
and Twist Biosciences who are working on automating and
miniturizing synthetic biology.  The chip techology
developed by Twist allows for millions of reactions to
take place on a single chip, something that would take a
large amount of laboratory space using traditional
equipment.

# Our algorithm
For this project we have developed a web based artificial intelligence agent
that will do the following. one, search pubmed central for full text papers
about a chosen cancer two, process these papers using artificial intelligence
and identify all potential antigens in these papers three, use artificial
intelligence to develop a robotic laboratory procedure using the ginkgo bioworks
platform to generate antibodies using phage display that can bind to these
antigens on MHC molecules.  Four generate patents with placeholders in them for
the sequences that will be generated on the Ginkgo Bioworks platform.  Five
write a business plan for a company that is going to be using a BiTE therapy to
cure a specific cancer.

# Demo
For our demo we first input the name of the cancer we
are interested in studying.  For this example we will use
IDH-wildtype gliobastoma, an often agressive form of brain cancer.
After we type the name of the cancer, the AI gives us a summary
of the cancer and does an analysis of how appropriate BiTE
therapy could be for this cancer.
After this, the AI does a search for any Pubmed Central papers
that would be helpful.  This process can take a considerable
amount of time.  Luckily in this case, we have results already
cached in the system.  
After this, the AI then searches through these papers to
find any antigens that appear to be overexpressed in
this cancer.  Here again this step takes a bit of time
to search all the 581 papers, but we can use a cached version.
The AI then develops pseudocode for the Ginkgo Bioworks
platform to carry out the experiments necessary to create
new antibody candidates and to sequence them. This process 
would take weeks to complete.  The output of this would be
a number of sequences of antibodies.
We then write patents with placeholders for the sequences
for the antibodies we create.
We then write a business plan for the business.
