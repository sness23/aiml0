a convergence of technologies is happening now that holds
immense potential for helping human health.  these are
artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, robotics
and miniturization.

there are approximately 100 million scientific papers
ever published and of those 30 million papers are in
biology.  we propose to use artificial intelligence
with retrieval augmented generation to solve various
biological problems.

there are many such problems in biology that we could attack,
such as life extension, development of vaccines, treatment
for rare diseases and cancer.  In the field of cancer, there
are many different kinds of treatments, some more amenable
to computational methods than others.  Some of these treatments
have the potential to be used for many different cancers,
we call these platforms.

One new platform that has been developed recently are BiTES or bispecific t-cell
engagers.  Tebentafusp is one of the first BiTES to be approved by the FDA for
treatment of uveal melanoma, a particularily aggressive eye cancer, others have
been approved and more are in development.

A BiTE is a synthetic protein with two parts, one that attaches to a killer
T-cell from the human immune system.  The other is an antibody that attaches
to a gp100 fragment presented by an MHC molecule on the cancer cell.  The
BiTE brings both cells into contact, and the killer T-cell destroys the
cancer cell.

The important part of this is the gp100 protein, an antigen that is found
on uveal melanoma cells.  We researched this and found that papers published
long before tebentafusp was developed had mentions of the gp100 protein.  We
propose to do this on an industrial scale and try to cure all cancers, starting
with the most low hanging fruit.

We propose to work with partners such as Ginkgo Bioworks and Twist Biosciences
who are working on automating and miniturizing synthetic biology.  The chip
techology developed by Twist allows for millions of reactions to take place
on a single chip, something that would take a large amount of laboratory
space using traditional equipment.

For this project we have developed a web based artificial intelligence agent that will

one, search pubmed central for full text papers about a chosen cancer

two, process these papers using artificial intelligence and identify all
potential antigens in these papers

three, use artificial intelligence to develop a robotic laboratory procedure using the ginkgo bioworks platform to generate antibodies using phage display that can bind to these
antigens on MHC molecules
